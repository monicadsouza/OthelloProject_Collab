# Project: Othello Game

This repository contains the source code for Group 22's implementation
of the Othello Game project in the Intelligent Systems Program course.

## Getting Started

The Othello.java is the main class that parses command line parameters and initializes the Othello game.
To run the game you can for example type "java Othello OthelloAI22 DumAi 6" in the terminal or go the the Othello class documentation
for the details.
The above commands set our group implementation to play against the dumb AI implementation, you can also try to play against our AI
by passim the 'human' command as first argument.
